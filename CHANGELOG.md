# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to
semantic versioning once it reaches 1.0.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`octoboard export-provenance`** — export the board as a signed,
  tamper-evident snapshot in the open `provenance/0` wire format. A portable,
  verifiable record of the board's risks, tasks, decisions, and reviews, useful
  on its own for audit trails, compliance archives, analytics, and moving state
  between tools. Ed25519 signing and canonical JSON are implemented as
  Blackboard's own infrastructure (`src/provenance-export.ts`); the format is an
  open contract of bytes, not a shared library. Options: `--out`, `--key`,
  `--as-actor`. See [docs/provenance-export.md](docs/provenance-export.md).

  `provenance/0` is consumer-agnostic: audit, analytics, governance, or a
  project-memory engine may consume it, and any such consumer is only one of
  many — Blackboard depends on none of them.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-01

### Documentation

- Added brand diagrams under `docs/diagrams/` (SVG source + PNG): a README
  banner, a before/after comparison, the value flow, and the accountability
  chain. Embedded in both READMEs.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-01

### Security / integrity (audit follow-ups)

- **External anchoring** closes the truncation gap. `blackboard anchor`
  records the current head (`seq:hash`) to a file or a git note; `blackboard
  verify --against <anchor>` proves the anchored history still exists and is
  unaltered (`ok` / `truncated` / `altered`) — so even an attacker who drops
  the append-only triggers and truncates the tail is caught. New
  `Board.head()` / `verifyAnchor()`.
- **Signed bundles.** `export` now signs the bundle with the active session's
  key; `import` verifies it and reports `signature ✓ / INVALID / unsigned`.
  `import --require-signed` refuses unsigned or tampered bundles. Gives sync
  origin authenticity, not just id-dedup. New `Board.verifyBundle()`.
- **Redaction is now true erasure for messages.** Message bodies are no longer
  duplicated into the hashed, append-only timeline (the summary is metadata-
  only); the body lives solely in `messages.body`, which `redact` blanks — so
  redacting a message removes its content from every storage location.
  Decision rationale likewise no longer goes into the timeline payload.
- **Consistent read snapshots.** `status`, `report`, and `listTaskCards` now
  run inside a single SQLite read snapshot, so a concurrent commit can't yield
  a view that mixes pre- and post-write state.

### Notes

- Agent *names* are handles, not authenticated identities; cryptographic
  identity comes from session signing (`sign` / `verify`, bundle signatures).
  Don't trust the `agent` name for authorization.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-01

### Security / integrity

- **Append-only is now enforced at the database layer.** `BEFORE UPDATE` /
  `BEFORE DELETE` triggers on the `timeline` refuse any modification or deletion
  of an audit row from any connection — "append-only by convention" is now
  "append-only by default". A determined attacker with DB access can still drop
  the triggers, but the hash chain + head anchor then detect the tamper.
- **Evidence is content-addressed.** Attaching a local file now stores its
  SHA-256, so a later swap/edit of the file is detectable. New `verifyEvidence()`
  / `blackboard evidence-verify` report `ok` / `changed` / `missing` / `unhashed`.
- `import` no longer appends an audit event on a pure no-op re-import.

Verified by a 10-process concurrency stress test (1000 concurrent writes, 0
lost, 0 duplicate/forked seq, chain intact, one task under 10 racing claims).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- The `serve` dashboard now shows the Octoryn brand mark instead of a placeholder
  emoji. The README shows the logo and a live screenshot of the kanban dashboard.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Tasks & kanban.** Tasks now carry a stable number (`#145`), description,
  project, impact (blast radius), risk level, and 0–100 progress. New commands
  `task add` / `task show` / `task status` / `tasks`, plus `assign` and
  `progress`. **Assigning is passive notification** — it records the assignee
  and drops a "please look at task #N" message in that agent's inbox; the agent
  reads it and decides to act, the board never launches anyone. The read-only
  `serve` dashboard gains a live kanban (columns by status; cards show number,
  progress bar, assignees, active-agent count, project, risk). MCP tools:
  `board_task_define`, `board_task`, `board_tasks`, `board_assign`,
  `board_progress`. Risks can be attached to a task (`risk --task`).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-01

### Documentation

- All documentation is now **bilingual** (English + 简体中文) with a top-of-file
  language switcher: `README`, `docs/attribution`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `CHANGELOG`.
- Corrected the MCP tool list in both READMEs to include every shipped tool.

### Changed

- Applied Prettier across `src/` and `tests/` (formatting only, no behavior
  change).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-01

First public release. A shared memory, attribution, and governance layer for AI
coding agents — it records and exposes; it never orchestrates.

### Added

- **Coordination core** — local-first SQLite board with a tamper-evident,
  hash-chained `timeline` (contiguity + head-anchor checks catch middle-row and
  tail truncation). Agents, tasks with conflict-aware claims, messages, handoffs
  (surfaced in the recipient's inbox), risks, decisions, evidence, file-change
  records.
- **AI attribution & shared development memory** — first-class sessions
  capturing machine/branch/repo context; provider-independent agent identity
  (`provider` / `model` / `cli` / `version`); attribution and reviews keyed to
  Git commits. Git integration is read-only plus additive `git notes` — history
  is never rewritten. Query layer: `who`, `explain`, `commits`, `unreviewed`,
  `joint`, line-level `blame` → narrative.
- **Governance chain** — `check` CI gate (exits non-zero on unreviewed AI work;
  requires an *approved* human review); `export` / `import` portable attribution
  bundles; `trailers`; `watch` / `since` subscribe primitive; session signing v0
  (Ed25519, `sign` / `verify` with trusted/stale/unanchored states).
- **Visibility** — `report` accountability scorecard (review coverage, AI/human
  ratio, per-agent); `blame` → session narrative; `serve` read-only web
  dashboard (dependency-free, loopback-only).
- **Team backend** — `sync` to a shared file or Postgres (portable records only,
  never the private hash chain); session `heartbeat` with active-vs-stale
  liveness and real-time same-file collision warnings; `prune` retention and
  `redact` read-layer redaction (the timeline is never pruned).
- **Transcript ingestion** — `ingest` adapters: a `generic` normalized schema
  (stable path for any CLI) plus a tool-use JSONL heuristic for
  `claude-code` / `codex` / `gemini` / `grok`.
- **Interfaces** — `octoboard` / `blackboard` CLI, an MCP stdio server
  (verified against the official SDK client), and `mcp-config` to generate
  one-step client config for Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, VS Code, and
  Windsurf. Programmatic library entry point.

### Security

- Git-facing helpers use `--end-of-options` / `--` so an attacker-controlled rev
  or path cannot be interpreted as a `git` flag (prevents arbitrary file write
  via `git show --output`, reachable over MCP).
- The dashboard binds to `127.0.0.1` by default (opt-in `--host`).
- `redact` blanks content across every read path (timeline overlay + source
  row); the review gate requires an approved outcome; `verify` surfaces an
  `unanchored` state when tail truncation cannot be ruled out.
- `synchronous=FULL` under WAL for audit-log durability; the active-session
  pointer is stored transactionally in the DB (no cross-process race); session
  private keys are `0600` under a `0700` directory.

### Notes

- Hardened across three rounds of adversarial review (correctness, security,
  persistence, and indexing). 59 tests.
- Known deferred limitations (documented in `docs/attribution.md`): merge
  commits attribute zero files; deleted files are attributed as "produced".
